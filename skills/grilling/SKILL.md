name: grilling
description: Use when the user wants a plan, design, decision, or idea stress-tested before work starts — "grill me", "poke holes in this", "challenge my plan", "interview me about this" — to reach a shared understanding through rounds of numbered questions with recommended answers.
---

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, code, tools, docs), look it up yourself — dispatch a sub-agent for it when one is available; don't ask the user for anything you could look up. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the answer; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.

When no human is reachable (a headless or automated run), there is no one to grill: list the open decisions with your recommended answers and stop rather than acting on them.
